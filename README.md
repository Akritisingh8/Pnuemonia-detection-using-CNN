# Pnuemonia-detection
Pneumonia Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks uses deep learning algorithms to identify and diagnose pneumonia from medical images. The process typically involves pre-processing the medical images to prepare them for input into the CNN model. The model then applies various convolutional and pooling layers to learn and extract features from the images.
